                            <p>Olympic medalist Michael Phelps, who retired in 2016 as the most decorated Olympian of all time, learned to manage his childhood ADHD and turn his hyperactivity into a strength during early adulthood.
                                In a February 2016 interview with Everyday Health, his mother, Debbie Phelps, said that his hyperactivity was noted by numerous teachers before he was diagnosed with ADHD at age 9. As a result, he began taking stimulant medication, which seemed to help him focus in school.
                                Debbie, also an educator, then helped her son learn the power of routine through participating in various sports, including competitive swimming. By age 12, Debbie says the gift of swimming allowed him to release his energy in the pool when he was coming off the medication. As an adult, Michael uses physical training and behavior modification — the same time management and concentration tools he learned at a young age — to manage his ADHD.
                                Outside the pool, he's focused on fatherhood and mental health advocacy. “I think the biggest thing for me, once I found that it was okay to talk to someone and seek help, I think that's something that has changed my life forever,” he told People in April 2017. “Now I'm able to live life to its fullest.”</p>

                        <p>British food activist and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, a learning disorder characterized by difficulty reading, in childhood. In a video interview with Made by Dyslexia, Oliver spoke about the challenges he faced in school as a result of these conditions.
                            “Who said education is what we say it is? Like a couple of dudes from 500 years ago sort of set up the structure of it — English, maths, science. Okay, so if you're not good at black-and-white and traditional academia … you have no value,” Oliver said. “So, for me personally, I've always been passionate since leaving school about different types of intelligence and everyone has the ability to be brilliant.”
                            According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/adhdfoundation/status/528079017799589888?lang=en">tweet from the ADHD Foundation</a>, Oliver advocates for healthy eating habits as a way to help manage ADHD symptoms.</p>
